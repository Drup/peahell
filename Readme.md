# Peyhel

Bunch of utilities for PL experiments. Originally based on boilerplates contained in the [plzoo](http://andrej.com/plzoo/), expanded to satisfy my use-cases.

It contains too libraries:
- `peyhel.native` to create a native binary that supports batch and repl modes.
- `peyhel.wen` to make an interactive Web repl

Here's the online REPL in action: [Affe](https://drup.github.io/pl-experiments/affe/).

To install :

```
opam install path/to/this
```
